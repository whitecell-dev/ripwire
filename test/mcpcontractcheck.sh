# mcpcontractcheck.sh — §B6 M1 / M2 / M4 / M11 / M12: the MCP surface's CONTRACT, pinned.
#
# The finding class this gate exists for is CONTRACT DIVERGENCE, not malformed input. Two verifiers have
# already proved this surface clean under ~85 hostile probes; what they could not see is that the same
# server described its arguments FOUR different ways —
#
#   1. the tools/list inputSchema (what a schema-driven client reads)
#   2. declaredFieldsFor / kMcpVerbFields (what the unknown-field guard enforces, and enumerates in its
#      own refusal: "analyze accepts: path, paths")
#   3. what the code actually CONSUMES
#   4. what the CLI does for the same request
#
# and that those four disagreed. `paths` was consumed on all 31 verbs and declared on 18; every `required`
# omitted `path`; 0 of 84 properties carried a description; and six single-root verbs answered a multi-root
# workspace with a refusal naming a FALSE cause.
#
# Every arm below compares two of those four columns. Nothing here restates a string the source owns — the
# expected sets are PARSED OUT OF src/mcprefusal.h, because a gate that restates the fix cannot notice the
# fix being un-done (the §B6 M14 lesson, and the shape arm (K) of mcpframehonestycheck already uses).

# has disclosed its blast-radius cut in prose all along (situ.h's situShowingNote, "showing N of M files —
# shown=N total=M capped=1"), so this was the two dialects disagreeing about the same run.

# equal the rows actually served, capped must equal shown < total — so a hand-written constant cannot
