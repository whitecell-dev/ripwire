#!/usr/bin/env bash
# mcptoolprunecheck.sh — the MCP catalog must advertise only verbs that CAN succeed on a PINNED workspace.
#
# THE FINDING (octocode recon F4, 2026-08-15): the pinned-root MCP listener advertised all 32 verbs in
# tools/list regardless of what the pinned workspace actually is. On a workspace that is not a git
# repository the git-backed verbs can only ever REFUSE, so every connected agent paid their schema bytes
# every turn to be told "not a git repository" if it ever tried one. octocode's server removes the routes
# for capabilities it does not have; this gate encodes the same rule for the one root we can prove.
#
# THE SCOPE, and why it is exactly this narrow. Omission is only honest when the verb provably cannot
# answer. It is provable for a PINNED root (`--listen`) and nowhere else: that listener serves ONE
# workspace fixed at startup and REFUSES a `path` naming a different tree, so a git verb there has no
# reachable git repo at all. A stdio server — bare, or with a `ripwire <root> --mcp` startup root — still
# answers read verbs about ANY path the caller names, so its git verbs can succeed and stay advertised.
# Arm (F) pins that half: the same non-git directory over stdio still advertises all 32.
#
# WHICH verbs, measured rather than assumed. The recon named five candidates; probing every git-touching
# verb against a non-git pinned root found only THREE that refuse unconditionally:
#     owners / whereis / stray_content    — refuse, always, with their own git cause
# Four others ANSWER without git and are NOT omitted (two of them from the recon's own five) — arm (E) is
# that measurement turned into a gate, so a later widening of the rule has to argue with a passing test
# rather than with a comment:
#     cochange              answers (commits:0 / at:null — the disclosure IS the git-less answer)
#     situational_awareness answers when `files` names the changed files instead of a git diff
#     quality_delta         answers against a quality_baseline SIDECAR (head_sha "(none — not a git repo)")
#     edit_check            answers (every symbol reads as new-symbol vs an absent HEAD)
#
# Omission is a DISCOVERABILITY change, never a capability removal: arm (D) proves an omitted verb still
# dispatches when called by name, refusing with its own honest git cause rather than "unknown tool".
#
# Arms:
#   (A) [red] non-git pinned root: owners / whereis / stray_content are ABSENT from tools/list; the other
#             29 are present, and the count is 29 — not 32.
#   (B) [red] the omission is SELF-DESCRIBING: initialize's `instructions` say the root is not a git
#             repository and NAME the omitted verbs. A silent omission is the dishonest version of this fix.
#   (C) [red] batch's own exclusion arithmetic MOVES with the omission: the "The other N advertised verbs"
#             count equals (advertised - the batch-served verbs still advertised), and the cross-branch
#             prose no longer names verbs this server does not advertise.
#   (D) [red] an omitted verb still DISPATCHES (tools/call owners → its git refusal, not "unknown tool").
#   (E) [red] the four measured non-git-refusing verbs stay advertised — the anti-over-prune arm.
#   (F)       stdio on the SAME non-git directory advertises all 32 and discloses nothing (per-call roots).
#   (G)       a GIT pinned root advertises all 32 and discloses nothing.
