    the 2930 literal was written on 2026-09-08 and PR #72 shifted rankGraphTeleport to 2943 the NEXT
    DAY, so the refusal lived about one day and never reached main — main's own 09-08 capture shows

    resolved to buildGraph. That shipped. It exited 0, so NO exit-code arm can ever see it — which is
    why showcasecapturecheck grew a live arm asserting the seed resolves to the symbol it names, and
    why deriving the line is not on its own enough.

A real re-derivation of a corpus that changed, not a tolerance edit; previously re-derived 2026-09-12 when the <d> rows dropped the path-repeating id= for the short sc= scope: the signature side shrank, the bodies did not; before that, 89.5% / 81.8% / 84.3% re-derived 2026-09-10 at the sibs= cap raise: kMaxExpandSibs went 8 -> 100, so --expand's <b> bodies now carry the file context the old cap hid — 89.3% of all sibling names — and the body side is this ratio's DENOMINATOR, so the figure rises without --pack-signatures eliding anything new. Measured on a fixed tree with the top-50 membership and the signature side unchanged: top-50 from 71.0. A real re-derivation of a corpus that changed, not a tolerance edit; previously re-derived 2026-09-09 at the printf-family -> std::print conversion: converting ~1,500 emitter call sites to rw::emitTo/emitRaw/formatTo across 93 files changes how large the ranked symbols' BODIES are, and the body side is this ratio's denominator — top-50 from 72.3. A real re-derivation of a corpus that changed, not a tolerance edit; previously re-derived 2026-09-08 at the confident-zero round, issues #62/#63/#66: that change adds symbols to src/graphlegend.h and the new src/preprocdead.h and re-homes two long comment blocks from call sites onto the helpers they explain, which moves both WHICH symbols the ranked top-50 holds and how large their bodies are — top-50 from 74.0. A real re-derivation of a corpus that changed, not a tolerance edit; previously re-derived 2026-09-06 at the stranger-audit fix round: the doctor, cache-sweep and html-provenance bodies grew this corpus's BODY side, moving top-50 from 75.6 — a real re-derivation, not a tolerance edit; before that, re-derived 2026-09-05 at the capture-audit close: lane L7's P16 caps --expand's sibs= at 8 names, which SHRINKS the body side of this ratio and moved the figure down from 84.5/80.2/80.6 — the V1 2026-08-15 re-center, when sibs=/inc= first grew the body side from 70.0/61.0/63.8, in reverse; both were real re-derivations, not tolerance edits). top-50 is the number to quote, because the sigs payload is top-50 regardless of --top-k and is therefore what THIS command emits. A single small/trivial body can still invert it (signature+doc bigger than the body), like the --format=columnar sibling below. test/showcasecapturecheck.sh (C) re-derives all three from this repo every run, in the same quantity, and fails if the caption and the recount drift apart.")

# healthy path (showcasecapturecheck arm E). A family substring is now the first of a preferred list that
# selects >= 1 local ref, else the first real ref itself; the caption follows the choice, so a checkout with
# none of the families still records an honest block (a REAL ref, caption saying so) rather than a refusal
# captioned as a measurement. 2026-09-10: the plain `--stray-content=lane` / `--stray-content=lane --abi` pair
# just below was still hard-coded to "lane" and hit the exact same failure the moment a checkout's short-lived
# `lane/*` branches were merged and deleted (routine post-merge cleanup, so this is the COMMON case, not an
# edge one) — moved onto the same _refFamily mechanism rather than adding a third ad hoc substring.
# 2026-09-12: the pick varies with whatever refs the recording checkout holds, so every part of a block now
# follows it. Captions NAME the substring (they said "lane-*" for any family, and "a second ref family" over a
# second block that repeated the first when only one family existed); the second block never re-selects what
# the first showed; the single-branch fallback is a branch no other ref's name contains, so its filter selects
# exactly that branch; every substring is shell-quoted, because add() runs through a shell and a ref name may
# carry characters the shell would expand; and the recorded output is checked against the heading before the
# capture is written (the stray-content agreement check after the run loop).

# branch and HEAD~N is relative. chooseInWindow measures instead, at generation time, against the PUBLISHED
# block — the same publish_block the document is written with, so what it checks is what a reader sees — and
# it takes the smallest N where BOTH N and N-1 satisfy every promise. N-1 is the margin the old comment asked
# for in words: the commit that lands the capture is itself a commit, so a published HEAD~N spans today's
# HEAD~(N-1) plus that commit the moment it is committed, and an N with no margin demonstrates in the
# document and stops demonstrating for anyone who pastes it. Nothing is pinned here but the corpus flags and
# the page size; if no N in range works, the generator REFUSES rather than publish a block that shows
# nothing, and the message says which half broke so the next person re-measures rather than re-guesses.

# Root-neutralise the published text: the checkout's absolute path is machine detail, not a claim
# (same rationale as the --pack-signatures methodology), and the public scrub gate bans home paths.
# Disclosed here rather than silent, in the order applied:
#   1. every occurrence of the repo root becomes "."
#   2. every occurrence of this run's per-run temp dir becomes "<scratch>" — same mechanism, same
#      reason: `/var/folders/…/ripwire_showcase_o6h2ey7l/aux/batch2.txt` is one mktemp draw on one
#      machine, so publishing it dates the document to a directory nobody can reproduce
#   3. the shared public-export scrub (exportscrub.scrub): home paths, other temp paths, internal
#      branch/document names, OWNERSHIP-row identity attributes and git author addresses. The last two
#      matter most here — --owners and --pr-context read real git history, so a capture of a real run
#      leaks real commit identities unless this runs. It is CONTEXT-GATED (see the long note in
#      docs/docs_commands_build.py): `top=` on --hotspots is a SYMBOL NAME and survives untouched, as
#      do ripwire's own `symbol@file.ext` community labels, which have the address shape but are not
#      addresses. One implementation, shared with docs/COMMANDS.md, so a widened scrub reaches both.

# checked but NOT substituted: an audit COORDINATE has no honest rewrite in a transcript (the
# generator DROPS such lines from COMMANDS.md samples, which a recorded run cannot do), so a coordinate
# reaching the output is a human decision about the source it came from, not something to paper over.
# The same goes for a rebrand rename row that survived publish_block: withholding takes out only a row
# that is its line's whole content, so one sharing a line with other output stops the write here.
