# rustqualcheck.sh — gate for the RUST half of §H4 (W3 lane):
# `::`-path calls extract at all, the canonical tier resolves them PRECISELY (including across
# DIRECTORIES), an EXTERNAL qualified call does not false-edge onto a same-named local def, `Self::`
# reaches its own impl, and the one genuinely ambiguous spelling is DISCLOSED rather than guessed.
#
# WHAT WAS BROKEN. queries/rust/tags.scm carried NO scoped_identifier call pattern, so 100% of Rust's
# DOMINANT call form — `Widget::new()`, `util::tool()`, `Self::helper()`, `Widget::bump(&w)` — produced
# no reference at all. The drop happened at EXTRACTION, before resolution, so `ambiguous=`/`unresolved=`
# (the tool's published call-graph completeness gauges) could not move: a reader had no signal whatsoever,
# in a language the tool GATE-CLAIMS (rustimportprecisecheck.sh ships).
#
# WHY THE PATTERN ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH (W1-MEASURE, recorded in the plan's §Execution). Rust defs carried
# scope="" and Rust refs carried qualifier="", so every widened edge fell to the bare-name spray, and:
#   (1) two types defining `new` in DIFFERENT directories hit §2a's tier-3 unique-or-DROP rule and BOTH
#       edges died SILENTLY — no amb=, no unresolved= movement, the flagship reflex still broken exactly
#       on idiomatic Rust;
#   (2) an external `Vec::<u32>::new()` false-edged onto a local `new`.
# So the lane ships pattern + per-ref qualifier + per-def scope + a qualified-scope guard. §4 and §5 below
# are the arms that would go green on the pattern alone and are therefore the ones that matter.
#
# EVERY expected count below is a LITERAL, read by hand off test/rustqualfix/src/*.rs (plan §7 trap 1: a
# gate that derives its expected number the way the code does cannot catch the derivation).
#
# RED-FIRST (measured 2026-07-31, plain build, pre-lane binary kept as build/ripwire_base):
#   fixture header       edges=2  ambiguous=0                (now 14 / 1)
#   --uses    0 for new, helper, tool, deepfn, generic, area, gadget_free, run   (now 4/2/1/1/1/1/1/1)
#   --callers 0 for new, helper, tool, deepfn, generic, area, gadget_free, run   (now 2/2/1/1/1/1/1/1)
#   --callees caller=2, crossdir_caller=0, amb_caller=0, bump=0, spin=0          (now 8/2/2/1/1)
#   --expand=bump returned the WHOLE `impl Widget { … }` block                   (now just bump's body)
#   34 of the gate's then-49 checks FAILED against build/ripwire_base; the counts above predate the V3
#   fixture additions (a top-level `new`, src/plainmod.rs, crossdir_amb, the detached pair), so read them
#   as the shape of the original red, not as literals to re-derive. The gate is now 56 checks.
#   The 15 that pass on BOTH are, by construction, controls and regression guards rather than evidence of
#   this round: the bare/method-call controls, the never-called `spin`, the "no edge to the STRUCT Widget"
#   and "no local ::new edge" negative arms (vacuous when nothing is extracted — see the three-state note
#   below), the §8 inherit arms, and the §9 hygiene arms.
#   The §5 no-false-edge arm is the one exception and needs a THREE-state reading, because base is
#   vacuously green (it extracts nothing at all): base --callees=external_caller = 0 (nothing extracted),
#   mid-lane at commit f2b3d40 (patterns + canonical tier, no guard) = 1, WRONGLY naming Widget::new,
#   final = 0. The middle state is the one this arm defends and it was measured live before the guard.
#
# RED-FIRST for the V3 verifier round (measured 2026-07-31 against the MERGED pre-fix binary, i.e. main with
# the lane's first four commits but without the M-2/M-3 fixes). 7 of the 56 checks FAIL there, and they are
# exactly the two findings:
#   M-3 (§3b)  --callees=crossdir_amb = 0 (silent drop) · no amb="1" row · only 2 of the 4 `<c n="run"/>`
#              rows · header ambiguous=1 not 2 · "unexpected amb= rows" naming only amb_caller
#   M-2 (§5)   --callees=external_caller = 1, binding the top-level `new` · --callers=new = 3 not 2
# The M-6 (§4) arm passes on BOTH binaries, because it defends the arm's DISCRIMINATION rather than a fix:
# its evidence is that rewriting `Self::detached()` bare moves --callees=bump 2 -> 3 and adds amb="1"
# (measured; recorded at the arm and in the fixture).

# reason the guard now tests FILE-MODULE MEMBERSHIP (graph.h::rustFileModuleOf) rather than "scope is empty".
