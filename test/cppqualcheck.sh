# cppqualcheck.sh — gate for §H4: C++ qualified calls extract at ANY
# `::` depth, explicit-template-argument calls extract at all, cast keywords extract NEVER, and the widened
# edges stay canonically PRECISE — with the one genuinely ambiguous spelling DISCLOSED rather than guessed.
#
# Before this fix a plainly written, single-target, statically resolvable call produced NO REFERENCE AT ALL
# when it was spelled with two or more `::` segments, or with explicit template arguments. The drop happened
# at EXTRACTION, before resolution, so `ambiguous=`/`unresolved=` — the tool's own published call-graph
# completeness gauges — could not move: the reader had no signal whatsoever. --uses/--callers/--edit-check
# silently under-reported on ripwire's own CLI<->MCP seam.
#
# §11 (added 2026-08-15) carries the DEFINITION half of the same grammar recursion: an out-of-line
# definition written with two or more qualifier segments was dropped by the mirror-image defect in the
# definition pattern, just as silently. Read its own section header for that round's evidence.
#
# §12 (added 2026-09-16) carries the MEMBER half of the explicit-template-argument drop: `r.f<T>( x )`,
# `p->f<T>( x )` and `x.template f<T>()` minted no reference, and the `template` disambiguator corrupted the
# name or qualifier of the qualified form. Read its own section header for that round's evidence.
#
# FOUR CORPORA. test/cppqualfix/ proves each CALL SPELLING extracts and resolves; every name in it has
# exactly one definition, so those arms cannot prove the re-split chose the RIGHT def. test/cppqualdecoyfix/
# (§8) gives each name a same-final-name DECOY in another scope, so a wrong qualifier binds provably wrong.
# test/cppqualdeffix/ (§11) is the definition-side corpus, with its own same-final-name decoy.
# test/cppqualtmplfix/ (§12) is the member-template corpus, with receiver, arity and qualifier decoys.
#
# EVERY expected count below is a LITERAL, read by hand off the fixtures (plan §7 trap 1: a gate that derives
# its expected number the way the code does cannot catch the derivation). Each fixture's header comment maps
# each spelling to the mechanism it proves.
#
# RED-FIRST (recorded 2026-07-31; three reference binaries, each pinned to what it proves):
#   vs build/ripwire_base (pre-§H4): 28 of the 49 checks fail —
#     fixture header edges=3 ambiguous=0   (now 11 / 1)
#     --uses: targetFn 0, make 0, get 0, pick 0, freeTmpl 0, scopedTmpl 0, Widget 0   (now 1/1/2/1/1/1/1)
#     repo root: --uses=selectBaseline 1, --callers=writeTally 0, --uses=writeTally 0, --uses=readWholeFile 1
#     --edit-check arity change on a 3-segment cross-file caller: callers="1"  (now "2", both incompatible)
#   vs build/ripwire_prefixup (§H4 as first shipped): the three §8 `>`-family arms fail — qualified
#     operator> / operator>> / operator>= bound the OUTER decoys at :65/:66/:67 instead of :76/:77/:78.
#   vs asan/ripwire_prefixup: §9's --from-trace arm exits 134 (sanitizer abort). The PLAIN build is silent
#     on that wrap, so §9 only carries evidence when RIPWIRE_BIN points at a G1 binary.
#   All 49 PASS against the fixed binary, plain AND asan (65 with §11's definition arm, added later).
#   (The four cast arms and the two most-vexing-parse arms pass on every binary by construction — they are
#   regression guards for a future round, not evidence of this one.)

# 23 -> 24 when src/quality.h's error-masking confirm read a block's RAW bytes through it (CodeRabbit on
# #127: a flattened block loses the newline that ends a // comment, so comment-only had to be confirmed raw).
# 24 -> 27 for #229: spellUncached reads the Python test source; pytestConfigAt reads pyproject.toml and
# setup.cfg through the same helper. All three qualified call sites were checked in --uses output.
# The literal counts REAL call sites, so it moves when a real call site is
# added; what it pins is that the qualified `docparse::detail::` spelling still RESOLVES, which is the defect
# this arm was written for. Bumping it is correct; changing it to a >= would retire the arm.
# 7 -> 9 2026-08-08: docTextViaBridgeCache (ingest.cpp) reads the doc bytes for its content-hash key and
# reads the cached blob back through the same canonical helper — both sites re-read before this re-pin.
# 9 -> 10 2026-08-15 (G3, report-ugrep §F2): grepApplyBooleanTerms' own ensureFileLoaded (search.h) re-reads
# a candidate file's bytes to test --and=/--not= terms — a THIRD search.h call site alongside grepEnrich's.
# 10 -> 11 2026-08-17 (§R-J, Wave-2 harvest): grepCollectAux (search.h) reads each unsupported-ext/
# text-looking candidate's bytes to scan it for the pattern — a FOURTH search.h call site.
# 11 -> 13 2026-08-24 (R1 identity round): TWO hand-rolled copies of this read retired in one lane.
# quality.h's per-file body walk was extracted to forEachSymbolBody (the R1 content-id index had copied it,
# and --quality-delta flagged the pair as a 495-token clone on the very run that added it), and
# mergescout.h's injectFileLevelFallback had a third copy of the same fopen/fseek/fread/fclose block. Both
# now call the canonical helper; both were re-read first to confirm the degrade is byte-identical (short
# read or ftell failure -> cleared buffer -> the file contributes nothing, silently).
# 13 -> 15 2026-08-28: the registered shell-gate index reads regression.sh and each registered gate through
# the same bounded helper, adding one site in registeredShellTokens and one in addRegisteredShellGate.
# 15 -> 17 2026-08-29 (merged round): TWO lanes each added one caller of the canonical whole-file read.
# (a) readRegisterMacrosConfig reads the new .ripwire_config sidecar through the
# same canonical helper rather than re-rolling its own fopen/fread.
# (b) cloneidiom.h's classifyCloneGroupIdioms reads each clone MEMBER's file through the
# same helper rather than re-rolling the fopen/fseek/fread block findClones carries — the fourth copy this
# arm exists to keep from being written.
# 17 -> 18 2026-08-30 (lane/at-seed): graph.h's resolveAtSeed reads the seed file's bytes through the
# same canonical helper to derive the seed line's byte range — the line-seeded selector's one file read.
# 18 -> 19 2026-09-04 (capture-audit lane L1, f97616d, H10): verbs_quality.h's ackNothingToAccept reads the
# on-disk ack ledger through the same canonical helper to decide whether the rendered ledger already equals its
# bytes (the idempotent-ack path). Measured 19 with BOTH the ec5e3c3 binary and the merged one on this tree —
# a corpus fact, not a resolver change.
# 19 -> 22 2026-09-09 (harvest githarden): githarden.h's local-config pre-scan reads the `.git` gitdir FILE, the
# gitdir's `commondir`, and each config candidate through the same canonical helper — three sites for one probe,
# rather than a fourth fopen/fread of its own.
# 24 -> 21 2026-09-16 (lane/git-and-tempfile-hardening): githarden.h's three local-config pre-scan reads
# (the `.git` gitdir file, commondir, each config candidate) moved to pathguard's non-blocking,
# regular-file-only read, retiring the three sites the 19 -> 22 step added.
# 21 -> 19 2026-09-17 (crash lane, #249, merged over the step above): the two fixed-name readers LEFT the canonical
# whole-file read for its regular-file-only sibling docparse::detail::readRegularFile, because a FIFO or a device link
# at the name hung the blocking open — quality.h's readRegisterMacrosConfig (.ripwire_config) and verbs_quality.h's
# ackNothingToAccept (the acks ledger). Disjoint from the three githarden.h sites; re-derived on the merged tree
# (20 grep lines = 19 call sites + the definition, and --uses answers 19).
# 19 -> 22: Python runner evidence reads source, pyproject.toml and setup.cfg (#229).
# 22 -> 23 2026-09-17 (#279 --lsp, @mpapis, on integration/train-4): src/lsp.h's hover reads the whole file through the

# ── §9 G1: an operator frame through --from-trace must not ABORT the sanitizer build ───────────────────
# stripTrailingGroup's reverse scan used the classic `for( i = n; i-- > 0; )`, whose final test wraps i to
# SIZE_MAX. That is a defined unsigned overflow, but `-fsanitize=integer -fno-sanitize-recover=all` ABORTS
# on it, and the wrap only happens when the scan runs off the front — i.e. on an UNBALANCED trailing group,
# which every `>`-family operator name supplies. Measured before the fix: rc=134.
#
# TWO THINGS MAKE THIS ARM MEAN SOMETHING, and it had neither when it was first written (V3-H-2):
#
#   (a) A POSITIVE CONTROL. `rc == 0` is satisfied by a run that never enters stripTrailingGroup at all — a
#       trace naming a symbol that is not in the corpus exits 0 just as happily. So the arm FIRST proves the
#       hostile frame was actually parsed and RESOLVED BY NAME. `resolved_by="name"` is the exact signal:
#       name resolution is what runs the frame's spelling through nameCandidates -> stripTemplateArgs, so
#       that attribute is the receipt that the scan was executed on `nsx::ops::operator>`. If --from-trace
#       ever stops parsing operator frames — or falls back to line-enclosure — this arm reds instead of
#       silently going vacuous.
#
#   (b) A FLAVOUR PROBE, so the arm cannot be mistaken for evidence it did not gather. The integer-overflow
#       class is ONLY observable under the G1 stack; a plain binary executes the same wrap in silence. The
#       probe reports which flavour ran. It deliberately does NOT fail on a plain binary — unlike
#       estchargecheck #14a, where the alert SHOULD be visible in the plain build and its absence means
#       NDEBUG — because here the plain build legitimately cannot see the class, and the whole suite runs
#       plain. What a plain rc=0 still buys: the frame parses, the scan terminates, and the document is
#       produced — everything except the sanitizer class. The abort evidence comes from CI, which runs this
#       gate under asan (.github/workflows/ci.yml, the G1 heavy-verb list).

#     `resolved_by="name"`, so a document-wide grep matches the LEGEND and passes on a frame that resolved
#     by line. (editcheckcheck.sh documents the identical trap for incompatible="1"; its `rows()` helper is
#     the pattern followed here.)
#   * `resolved_by` is the whole assertion. A frame naming a symbol that does not exist ANYWHERE still comes
#     back with n="operator&gt;" p="edge.cpp:8" — because line-enclosure binds it to whatever squats on line
#     8. Measured: an absent-symbol frame yields resolved_by="line" with byte-identical n=/p=. Asserting the
#     obvious n=/p= pair alone would therefore have been satisfied by a frame the name ladder never touched.
