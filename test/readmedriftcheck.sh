# readmedriftcheck.sh — README.md's ADVERTISED COUNTS must not drift from the things that justify
# them: the "N flags" claim from the binary's own --help table (arms A-D), and the lineage sentence's
# repository/paper/survey counts from docs/LINEAGE.md's own tables (arm E).
#
# WHY. README.md:15 states a flag count in prose ("Around that core sit N long flags advertised in
# `--help`…"). Nothing else in the suite checks that number against reality, so it silently goes
# stale the moment a flag is added, renamed, or removed — the exact failure showcasecapturecheck's
# caption arm exists to catch for a different document. This gate is that same discipline applied to
# the README's own flag-count sentence.
#
# DERIVATION. Reuses flagsurfacecheck.sh's own harvest idiom verbatim: `--help` text scraped with
# `grep -oE '\-\-[a-z][a-z0-9-]+' | sort -u`, i.e. anchored on the "--name" TOKEN, not on its column
# position. An earlier version of this gate anchored on a 4-space-indented line start (`^    --`),
# which undercounts — --help writes optional/alternative forms as "[--around-depth=N]" or
# "(--regex)", which a whitespace anchor misses entirely, and flagsurfacecheck.sh's own header
# comment warns against exactly this trap. Three in-tree derivations of "the flag count" existed at
# once (this gate's old 104, docs/docs_commands_build.py's 102, flagsurfacecheck.sh's 123) because
# each scraped --help slightly differently; arm (D) below pins this gate's derivation to
# flagsurfacecheck.sh's so the two can never drift apart again. (docs_commands_build.py's 102 counts
# a different, deliberately narrower thing — its own documented-vs-binary set — and is left alone;
# see CLAUDE.md.)
#
# Arms:
#   (A) derive the distinct flag count from --help and confirm it is a sane positive number
#   (B) the DRIFT arm — README.md's stated count must equal the derived count
#   (C) MUTATION CONTROL for (B) — a copy of README.md with a deliberately wrong count must be
#       caught red by the same comparison, proving the arm can actually see a mismatch
#   (D) CROSS-CHECK — this gate's derived count must equal flagsurfacecheck.sh's own harvested count
#       of the SAME --help text, so the two scripts' notions of "the flag count" can never disagree
#   (E) the LINEAGE arm — README.md's "M repositories and P papers … survey of N tools" sentence must
#       equal the row counts of docs/LINEAGE.md's own tables. Same discipline as (B), different
#       ground truth: an advertised number is an ENUMERATED number, so the enumeration is the
#       authority and the prose is checked against it. Sub-arms E1-E9 below; E4 is (E)'s mutation
#       control, exactly as (C) is (B)'s, and E6/E7 carry their own. E9 checks a SECOND restatement
#       of the folded/surveyed pair that drifted independently of the one E5 checks — see E9's own
#       comment for the round that found it stale.
#   (G) the COLD-START arm — README's "start here" invocation must carry --max-tokens=N, and that N must
#       keep the bare map's head under 4,500 est_tokens (G1 presence, G2 property, G3 mutation, G4 promise)
#
# WHY E6-E8 EXIST. A count can be arithmetically correct and still be a lie about a SET. LINEAGE.md
# claims its folded tables and its surveyed table are DISJOINT — that is what makes "36 folded plus
# 231 surveyed" an addition rather than a subset relation, and it is the whole justification for
# printing both numbers in one sentence. Nothing checked it, and it was false in four places at once
# (Aider, Cody and octocode were folded rows repeated in the survey; RepoGraph was a §2 paper row
# repeated there too). E7's failure mode is cheaper still: `comby` was listed in two different
# surveyed rows, so N counted one tool twice and every row's n stayed internally consistent while
# doing it — E3 cannot see that, because E3 only ever looks at one row. E8 checks the other half of
# the honesty rule: a folded row must point at a real flag or source file, so the paths it points at
# have to exist.
#
# WHY (E) EXISTS AT ALL. Three counts in one README sentence, each justified by a different table in
# a different file, is the drift shape this suite has been bitten by twice (the flag count above; the
# docs/README.md entry count). A count nobody re-derives is a count that is already wrong and has not
# been caught yet. LINEAGE.md's header repeats the same three numbers in prose, so E5 checks THAT
# against the same tables too — a document whose own summary disagrees with its own rows is worse
# than one that never summarised.
#
# LINEAGE DERIVATION. Section-scoped markdown table rows, structural not textual:
#   M = body rows of the table under the "Folded" heading                       (repositories)
#   P = body rows under "Classic papers" + body rows under "Modern research"    (papers)
#   N = the sum of the trailing `n` column of the "Surveyed" table              (tools surveyed)
# A body row is a line starting with `|` that is neither the header row (the first such line in the
# section) nor the `| --- |` separator. Deriving N from a SUMMED COLUMN rather than by counting names
# across a whole table is what makes the number auditable per row; E3 then proves each row's declared
# `n` equals the count of its own comma-separated names, so the column cannot be quietly padded.

# ── (E) the LINEAGE arm — the README's three advertised counts vs docs/LINEAGE.md's own tables ──────
# The extractor is shared by both files on purpose: LINEAGE.md bolds the numbers (`**29 repositories**
# and **37 papers**`) and README.md bolds the pair (`**29 repositories and 37 papers**`), so `*` is
# stripped before matching and ONE regex covers both spellings. Anchoring on the WORDS rather than on
# a line number or a bold-marker position means a rewrap or a re-bold cannot silently disarm the arm.
# The whole file is flattened to ONE line before matching, because prose wraps: an editor that broke
# "survey of\n220 tools" across a line boundary would otherwise make a line-oriented grep report "no
# sentence found" — loud, but for the wrong reason, and one reflow away from a maintainer deleting the
# arm as broken. Flattening makes the claimed rewrap-immunity actually true.
# `head -1` in both extractions below is DELIBERATE and covered, not an oversight: (E2) asks whether the
# FIRST copy agrees with the tables, and (E2b)/(E2d) ask whether EVERY copy agrees with each other — one
# distinct value each, however many times the claim is printed. The two halves compose: first-copy-correct
# plus all-copies-equal is all-copies-correct. Neither arm on its own is enough, which is why both exist
# and why a third spelling of either claim (README says "The survey describes N tools" once) is reported
# below as the population these matchers do NOT reach rather than left for someone to assume they do.

# sentence still said "34 folded plus 222 surveyed -- not 34 picked out of 222". The gate's OWN
# header comment was a round older again at "27 folded plus 220 surveyed". Prose that illustrates a
# derived number is itself a claim about that number, and an unchecked illustration drifts exactly
# like an unchecked headline -- it just looks like commentary, which is why nobody re-derives it.
# The sentence carries FOUR numbers, not two: "N folded plus M surveyed -- not X picked out of Y".
# An earlier draft of this arm checked only N and M. That is exactly where round-c's copy of this
# sentence went wrong -- "41 folded plus 237 surveyed -- not 41 picked out of 239", with 237 and 239
# two clauses apart -- and nothing saw it. All four must equal the table-derived pair. Flattened

# ── (E6/E7) the DISJOINTNESS arms — the set claim behind the counts ─────────────────────────────────
# NAME EXTRACTION, and why it is not a plain string compare. A folded row spells a tool the way its
# own project does ("[Sourcegraph / Cody]", "[aider repo-map]"); the survey table spells the same tool
# the way a catalogue does ("Cody", "Aider"). A whole-cell comparison sees no overlap and passes while
# the document counts one tool twice — which is exactly how Aider and Cody survived review. So each
# folded entry expands to a KEY SET: its normalised whole name, each slash-separated alternative, and
# (for §3a repository rows only) each space-separated word of four characters or more. Normalisation
# is lowercase-and-drop-everything-but-alphanumerics, so "grep.app" and "tree-sitter" compare as one
# token each and punctuation style cannot hide a duplicate.
#
# The word-split is deliberately NOT applied to §2, whose first column is prose ("Metric feedback into
# the loop"): splitting that into words would put common nouns in the key set and invite a false
# positive, and it is not needed — the §2 duplicate this arm was written for, RepoGraph, is the entire
# cell before the em dash. §2 therefore contributes only whole-name and slash-alternative keys.

# fix: a claim about the counts is not exempt from the arm for living inside a slide generator.

# ── (G) the COLD-START arm — README's "start here" invocation must disclose a budget ────────────────
# README.md teaches two "start here" invocations (the build-from-source block and "Four commands worth
# learning first"). A bare `ripwire .` is the commonest first call an agent makes in a session (13% of
# observed calls, capture-audit round 2026-09-04, finding P15) and costs ~9K est_tokens on this repo,
# where `--max-tokens=3000` serves the SAME head at under a third of that. The binary's own default is
# deliberately unchanged (owner call — dozens of gates parse the bare map); the guidance is what moves,
# and this arm keeps it moved. Three sub-arms, same shape as (B)/(C): the property, its mutation
# control, and a proof that the advertised budget line keeps the promise its comment makes.
#
# DERIVATION. A "start here" line is a fenced-bash line (README's own comment idiom marks it with the
# words "start here") that invokes ripwire on `.`; it is BARE when no `--` flag sits between the root
# argument and the comment. Anchored on the comment WORDS, not a line number, so a re-order of the
# Quickstart cannot disarm the arm; presence-guarded (G1) so a rewrite that drops the idiom fails loud
# instead of passing vacuously — the "green while inert" failure mode CONTRIBUTING.md §2 names.

# and a 222-tool survey" while its own <details> body, two lines below, said 42 and 237 — stale on two
# of three counts. Arms (E1..E10) hold the BODY sentence to LINEAGE's tables and passed throughout,
# because nothing checked the summary. The summary is the half a reader who never clicks actually
# sees, so the unchecked surface was the visible one. Every collapse since has put more numbers there.
#
# (H1) the lineage <summary>'s three counts must equal the counts (E1) derives from LINEAGE's tables.

# ── (J) the SKILLS arm — three defensible counts of one directory, and README states all three ─────
# WHY. `skills/` can be counted three ways and every one of them is defensible, which is exactly how
# this drifted. `ls skills/*/SKILL.md` is the ROUTABLE set that skills/CONSOLIDATION.md pins ("30 →
# 17 routable skills"). `find skills -name SKILL.md` is one more, because it also finds the
# Hermes-native skill under skills/hermes/. And the set the installer activates for every agent is one
# FEWER, because ripwire-opt-remarks carries `audience: contributor` in its front matter and
# install.sh's is_contributor_skill() gates it behind --contributor. Before this arm README.md said
# seventeen in the install fold and eighteen in two other places, and nothing in the tree could say
# which was meant — the "one list counts four defensible ways" failure, on a number we advertise.
#
# So this arm does not check "the" skill count. It derives all three from the tree, then pins each
# README sentence to the count it is actually claiming.
#
#   (J1) derive routable / all / every-agent, and sanity-check them against each other
#   (J2) every "<N> task-shaped skills" and "<N> routable skills" claim must equal ROUTABLE
#   (J3) the install fold's "<N> of the <M> are for using the tool" must equal (every-agent, routable)
#   (J4) mutation control for (J2) — a fabricated count must be seen as disagreeing
#
# A claim whose leading token is neither a numeral nor a number word ("the task-shaped skills that
# teach your agent…") is prose, not a count, and is skipped on purpose; (J2) requires at least two
# real claims so that rewording every count away cannot make the arm pass vacuously.

# WHY. --json is an allow-list, and the binary already carries the list: `--help=--json` names every
# supported verb, and refusing verbs name it again on stderr. README §6.3 restates that list in prose.
# A verb that gains --json support tomorrow updates the binary and leaves the guide describing a
# smaller tool — the same defect class as (B) and (J), on a SET rather than a count. This arm reads the
# binary's own enumeration and requires the two to agree in both directions.
#
# `--help=--json` is used rather than a refusal message because it needs no corpus: the arm costs one
# help invocation, not an index.
#
#   (K1) harvest the allow-list from --help=--json and sanity-check its size
#   (K2) README's §6.3 list must equal it — no verb missing, no verb invented
#   (K3) mutation control — dropping a verb from a COPY of the README list must be seen

# ── (L) the CAP INVENTORY arm — README's fourth advertised number ──────────────────────────────────

# docs/limits_build.py derives it from src/ and --check proves docs/LIMITS.md against the tree — and
# nothing tied the README's restatement to it. It was 208 against a real 210 when this arm was
# written. Same class as (B) and (K): a number with an enumeration behind it and no arm in between.
#
# The generator is the ground truth rather than LIMITS.md's prose, so a LIMITS.md that has itself gone
# stale fails here instead of being believed. It costs ~0.3 s (a python pass over src/, no build), so
# it stays inside this gate's budget.
