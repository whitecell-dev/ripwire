//   • mcpjson.h  — the JSON-RPC protocol layer (parse/escape helpers; no index dependency)
//   • mcpindex.h — the warm in-memory McpIndex, staleness/watcher machinery, getIndex(),
//                  the workspace registry, and the stable content-handle system   (includes mcpjson.h)
//   • mcpverbs.h — the per-verb text/JSON builders (for/lego/impact/uses/connect/fetch_body/…)  (includes mcpindex.h)
//   • mcpedit.h  — the symbol-addressed EDIT verbs + runEditVerb()                 (includes mcpindex.h)
// Include direction is strictly one-way: mcpjson → mcpindex → {mcpverbs, mcpedit} → mcp. No cycles.

#include "mcpverbs.h"      // the read/flagship verb builders runMcp dispatches to (pulls mcpindex.h → mcpjson.h)

// absent from kBatchServedVerbs, so the first subtraction has already excluded it, and the count came out
// 15 where 16 verbs actually refuse. That the assert passed is the tell: it pinned the wrong number, so it
// would have fired on a future CORRECT edit. The stanza's own prose lists the exclusions by name and lists
// SEVENTEEN of them (3 edit + quality_baseline + quality_delta + batch + the 10 whole-repo/cross-branch
// verbs + slice, the lane/tc-sliceat per-definition read not yet in the sweep), which is the arithmetic
// below and was never the number printed beside it.

//   • pinnedRoot — empty over stdio (a request may name ANY path). Non-empty over the remote transport:
//     the listener serves exactly ONE workspace fixed at startup ("one listener =
//     ONE workspace"). A tools/call whose `path`/`paths` names a DIFFERENT tree is refused with a clean
//     error and NO index rebuild; an OMITTED path defaults to the pinned workspace.
//   • defaultRoot (D3/D4, X7) — stdio's own, SOFTER counterpart of pinnedRoot: non-empty only when
//     `ripwire <root> --mcp` was given a startup root (mutually exclusive with pinnedRoot — stdio never
//     sets pinnedRoot). An OMITTED path defaults to it for every verb, mirroring the HTTP default-to-pinned
//     step above; but unlike pinnedRoot, an EXPLICIT path naming a different tree is only refused for the 3
//     EDIT verbs (a read verb reaching across a sibling checkout is a feature stdio has always offered).
//   • editsAllowed — true over stdio (a co-located agent). false over the remote transport by default
//     (a remote agent editing local files is a categorically different trust
//     contract, so an edit verb is refused (file byte-identical) unless the operator opted in with
//     --allow-remote-edits, which also forces the bearer-token requirement.
//   • assumedRoot (R2a, the 2026-08-12 usage mine) — the SOFTEST tier, below defaultRoot: the shipped
//     install (`ripwire wrap …` → bare `--mcp`, no startup root) refused every omitted `path`, and the
//     mine shows a missing `path` is THE dominant MCP failure mode. But that server still has a root:
//     the directory its host launched it in (MCP hosts launch stdio servers in the workspace). Resolved
//     once at startup (getcwd, guarded — never "/" and never $HOME itself: a crawl of either is nobody's
//     workspace, so those keep the explicit-path refusal), consulted ONLY when a request omits `path`
//     AND no defaultRoot/pinnedRoot exists, and always DISCLOSED in the response envelope
//     (`_assumed_root`) — one-step-smart-defaults: the cheapest complete answer, said out loud.
//     Empty ⇒ the pre-R2a "every request names its own path" refusal, unchanged.
//   • pinnedRootHasGit (V3/F4) — meaningful ONLY beside a non-empty pinnedRoot: can the git-backed verbs
//     (mcprefusal.h's kMcpGitOnlyVerbs) answer about that workspace at all? Resolved ONCE at listener
//     startup (mcpserver.h) because the workspace is fixed for the listener's life and the probe forks git.
//     false ⇒ those verbs are OMITTED from tools/list and the omission is announced in `instructions`.
//     Defaults TRUE so every stdio path (which never pins) advertises the full catalog untouched — see
//     the omitGitVerbs comment in the tools/list branch for why omission is pinned-only.
//   - pinnedRootIsGitDir (finding #7) — meaningful ONLY when pinnedRootHasGit is false: does the workspace
//     sit INSIDE a git repo at all (`.git` present, `rev-parse --show-toplevel` succeeds) that simply has
//     no HEAD commit yet, versus not being a git repo in the first place? The two causes were collapsed
//     into one sentence ("this server's workspace is not a git repository") that is FALSE for the first
//     case — a `git init` with no commit IS a git repository, it has no HEAD, exactly the qualifier every

// is `name` one of the 3 side-effecting edit verbs? (the remote transport refuses these unless opted in).
//
// §H2 — this predicate ALSO gates the pre-dispatch required-field check in dispatchMcpLine, for one reason:
// these are the verbs where a missing argument is not a wrong ANSWER but a wrong WRITE. The three edit arms
// guarded `path` + `symbol` and never tested the PAYLOAD field, so an omitted new_body / text reached
// runEditVerb as an empty string and was APPLIED — replace_symbol_body with no new_body answered
// {"applied":…} and DELETED the definition from disk, on both transports. A read verb reaches the same
// missing-field message by FALL-THROUGH (only if no arm matched, i.e. only if every conjunct was
// remembered); for a write verb that is too late and too easy to forget, so the verdict is taken from the
// table (mcprefusal.h's kMcpRequiredFields, rendered by the SAME missingArgMsg the fall-through uses, so
// there is one wording in one place) BEFORE the dispatch chain — no getIndex(), no open, no byte written.
//
// Keyed on this predicate rather than written out as three more arm conjuncts because the conjunct list is
// exactly what drifted from the table, and because a FOURTH edit verb then inherits the check by joining
// the one list that already decides "does this write" — which as of the wave-1 sweep is literally true:
// isMcpEditVerb reads `kMcpVerbTable`'s own `McpVerbGroup::Edit` column, so "joining the list" is joining the
// registry. When this sentence was first written the predicate spelled the three names out and the claim was
// aspirational; see the sweep note at isMcpEditVerb. Deliberately NOT hoisted for the read verbs: the
// enumeration arm of test/mcpeditpresencecheck.sh shows all 27 other required-field cases already refuse
// correctly, and hoisting it for them would reorder refusals other gates pin (connect reports a bad
// `radius` before an absent `symbols`).
//
// So the edit arms below must NOT re-state the payload as a conjunct, and must never read an absent payload
// as "splice nothing". An OMITTED payload and an explicit `new_body:""` are the same refusal, on argPresent's
// emptiness contract — the meaning "present" already has for all 13 schema-typed string fields, and the one
// the table's own wording implies ("the complete, well-formed replacement definition"). An empty new_body is
// NOT read as a delete-the-body request: it is the mistyped/unset argument that used to delete bodies.
//
// ── ITEM A (pre-wave verifier, MED): the equivalence class is WIDER than "" ─────────────────────────────
//
// The ruling above was pinned as "present" == `!newBody.empty()`, so anything of size >= 1 passed it — and a
// WHITESPACE-ONLY payload still deleted the definition and reported {"applied":…}: `new_body:" "`, `"\n"`,
// `"\t"`, `"   \n\t  "` each replaced `int alpha( int x ) { return x + 1; }` with a blank line, on stdio AND
// over HTTP with --allow-remote-edits. The verifier is right that this is the same finding: the class the §H2
// ruling belongs to is "a payload that carries NO DEFINITION", and the table's own words for the field are
// "the complete, well-formed replacement definition". Nothing whose every character is invisible is that.
//
// THE RULING, and its bright line. A payload carries content iff it has at least ONE code point that occupies
// a visible column. NUL is deliberately not its own case: a payload of NULs is no more a definition than a
// payload of spaces, and a client that reached `U+0000` for a definition has the same unset-argument bug.
// (A NUL *inside* real content is untouched — the rule is about payloads that are ENTIRELY invisible, never
// about individual bytes. This comment SPELLS the character rather than containing one; see the F3 note in
// src/infra/blanktext.h for what the literal byte cost.)
//
// An INVALID UTF-8 byte counts as CONTENT, and so does an unassigned (Cn) code point: garbage bytes are a
// different problem with a different fix, and silently widening a write refusal to cover them would blame this
// field. The asymmetry is deliberate and it has a direction — over-refusing costs a rejected write the caller
// sees in a named refusal and can retry; under-refusing DELETES a definition and reports success.
//
// ── WAVE-1 VERIFIER (F2, MED) + (F3, MED) — MOVED to src/infra/blanktext.h ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The derived blank-code-point TABLE, the two UTF-8 walks over it (hasVisibleContent / blankPayloadSpelling)
// and the two verifier findings that shaped them now live in **src/infra/blanktext.h**, included at the top of this
// file. §S3 (capture-audit-4) found `--note-add` answering the SAME "present but carries nothing" question
// with a THIRD, weaker predicate, so the rule was hoisted out of this MCP server rather than copied again.
// The ruling ABOVE and the SCOPE below are MCP's and stay here; the table is text machinery and is not.
//
// SCOPE — the three PAYLOAD fields only (`new_body`, `text`), never the read verbs' required strings. That is
// not timidity, it is that the widening would be WRONG for them: `pattern:" "` is a legitimate literal search
// for a space, and `symbol:" "` / `task:" "` / `file:" "` / `handle:" "` already refuse truthfully with the
// spelling echoed ("symbol not found: ' '") — a second sentence for a case already refused correctly is noise.
// insert_before/insert_after are ruled the SAME as replace even though inserting whitespace is benign
// (they only insert): a per-verb carve-out at a write seam is how the next one gets forgotten, and "the text
// to insert" is not a description of a blank.
// ── WAVE-1 SWEEP (this lane): the guard that was never wired to the table it already has ─────────────────
//
// This predicate used to spell the three names out as a disjunction, immediately under a comment claiming that
// "a FOURTH edit verb then inherits the check by joining the one list that already decides 'does this write'".
// The claim was false: the list a new verb joins is `kMcpVerbTable`, which has declared `McpVerbGroup::Edit`
// for exactly these three since A4-S2 — the disjunction here was a SECOND list, and the one a fourth verb
// would not be in. That matters more than the usual duplicate-table complaint because this predicate is the
// sole gate on THREE safety decisions: the remote transport's edit refusal (`!policy.editsAllowed`), the
// off-workspace-root refusal for writes, and §H2's pre-dispatch required-field check. A fourth edit verb added
// to the registry would have shipped with none of them, writing to disk over an un-opted-in remote transport
// with an unchecked payload — which is §H2 and the remote-edit contract, both, in one omission.
//
// So the verdict now comes from the registry's own group column. Same answer today (asserted below), and a new
// row tagged Edit inherits all three guards by existing.
