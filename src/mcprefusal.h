// mcprefusal.h — THE MCP REFUSAL VOCABULARY: one statement of what a refusal says, for both dispatch arms.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The MCP surface dispatches TWICE — the live server's `tools/call` chain (mcp.h) and
// the `batch` verb's sub-query chain (mcpverbs.h's runBatchSub) — and every refusal was written out twice,
// independently, so the same condition arrived in three different wordings across the tool:
//
//     condition                     CLI                          live arm                    batch arm
//     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//     empty required value          flag + problem + EXAMPLE     "missing required field: X" "missing X"
//     symbol does not resolve       noun + ECHO + did-you-mean   "symbol not found"          "symbol not found"
//     name is not a verb            —                            "unknown tool or missing args" (conflated)
//
// §B6 M7/M8/M9 fix all three by making the wording a TABLE plus three renderers, which both arms call. The
// house rule this follows is the one cli.h's refuseEmptyValue already established for the 16 value-taking
// flags: a new verb inherits the refusal by filling in table columns, not by remembering to copy a
// paragraph — and a fix lands on both arms because there is only one place to land.
//
// The `flags` verb (mcp.h's flip branch) already echoed the spelling AND offered near-misses before this
// file existed; it is the proof the shape is cheap, and it is the shape generalized here.

// actually types, not the CLI flag spelling, because that is what the reader has to fix.
// `Optional` rows are never reported missing — they are in the table for their OTHER two columns (the
// not-found hint, and the one wording of what the field is), which a verb whose field is optional needs
// just as much as a verb whose field is required (verifier N7: `owners`' symbol is optional and its

//     clamped silently to the ceiling. Every one of them now names its DOMAIN here.
//   • STRING — thirteen fields the inputSchemas declare as strings and both arms read through the bare
//     findString path, so a present-but-wrong-shaped value read as ABSENT and the verb served its default:
//     `situational_awareness diff:["a","b"]` answered about the working tree and reported it clean with full
//     confidence (the N11 class, one field over), and `kind`/`symbol` on five verbs silently dropped a
//     non-string filter. `path`/`file`/`handle`/`new_body`/`text`/… are here for the same reason.
//   • ARRAY — the three schema-typed arrays. A wrong SHAPE (`connect symbols:5`, `analyze paths:5`,
//     `batch queries:5`) reported "missing required field", i.e. exactly the absent-vs-wrong-shape collapse
//     findRawValue exists to separate, and `connect symbols:["main"]` got a bespoke fourth-dialect sentence
//     ("connect needs 2..16 symbols (got 1)") instead of the domain clause and a runnable example.

// A verb that can only answer about ONE tree, handed a multi-root `paths` workspace, had no way to say so:
// `quality_baseline` rendered the raw \x1f-separated workspace REGISTRY KEY into a client-facing message
// under `-32603` with the cause "unwritable directory?" — three lies in one sentence (an internal key as a
// path, an internal-error code for a usage error, and a filesystem cause for a shape problem).
//
// This renderer is the seam: it names the verb, states that it is single-root, says WHY in the verb's own
// terms, and tells the caller what to send — WITHOUT ever rendering the key. §B6 M1 (the other single-root
// verbs, which today answer with false causes of their own) is a separate item and joins by adding call
// sites here, not by writing a second sentence.

}

// ─── §B6 M1: WHICH verbs are single-root, as a table — the MCP twin of the CLI's enumeration ─────────────
//
// Wave 1 built singleRootRefusal and wired it to exactly ONE verb (quality_baseline). Every other
// single-root verb kept answering a multi-root `paths` request with a refusal of its own, naming a cause
// that is FALSE on two real git repos:
//
//   whereis / stray_content -> "not a git repository (or no HEAD commit) — no refs to search"   (both are)
//   quality_delta           -> "no .ripwire_quality_baseline and no git HEAD to auto-compare against"
//   edit_check              -> "symbol not found: 'X'"   for a symbol find_symbol RETURNS on the same paths
//   owners                  -> "no git history for this tree (not a repo, or no commits)"        (it has)
//   situational_awareness   -> "no changed files given and no git diff"
//
// Each of those sentences sends the caller to fix a repo that is not broken. The cause is always the same
// one thing — the verb reads git/HEAD through a path that is a multi-root workspace REGISTRY KEY, not a
// directory — so it is named once, here, and the reason column says why THAT verb cannot merge roots.
//
// The set is not invented: the first four are exactly the verbs the CLI refuses for the same reason
// (main.cpp's multi-root refusal block, plus the per-verb --whereis/--stray-content refusals), verified
// verb-for-verb on a two-root fixture. `owners` and `situational_awareness` are the INVERTED pair — the CLI
// ANSWERS them multi-root and the MCP arm cannot, because their MCP path has no per-root git plumbing. They
// are listed so their refusal states the true cause and an actionable fix; closing the inversion for real
// means porting the CLI's per-root iteration into the MCP arm, which is a feature, not a disclosure fix.
//
// `batch` is deliberately ABSENT even though the CLI refuses `--batch` multi-root: the MCP batch verb runs
// its sub-queries against the MERGED index like every other read verb, and demonstrably answers correctly,
// so refusing it here would delete working behaviour to match a CLI restriction that looks like the
// questionable side of that divergence.
// The shape EVERY "this verb cannot answer here, and here is why" rule table shares: the verb, and the
// clause its refusal (or its omission note) renders as the reason. Named once because the tables below are
// not two kinds of thing — they are two answers to the same question about different conditions — and so

// regardless, and a non-git workspace paid ~9.1K est-tokens of schema per turn for verbs that could only
// refuse. This table is the "can it succeed here" half of that fix; mcp.h owns the omission itself.
//
// THE MEMBERSHIP RULE, and why it is only three. A verb belongs here iff a non-git root makes it refuse
// UNCONDITIONALLY — no argument, no sidecar, no fallback reaches an answer. The recon named five; probing
// each against a non-git pinned root (test/mcptoolprunecheck.sh arm (E) is that probe, kept as a gate)
// found only these three. The other four git-TOUCHING verbs answer, and are deliberately absent:
//   cochange              answers with commits:0 / at:null — the disclosure IS the git-less answer
//   situational_awareness answers when `files` names the changed files instead of a git diff
//   quality_delta         answers against a quality_baseline SIDECAR (head_sha "(none — not a git repo)")
//   edit_check            answers (every symbol reads as new-symbol against an absent HEAD)
// Omitting one of those would advertise LESS than the server can do, which is the same class of dishonesty
// as advertising more — so the rule is "provably cannot", never "probably will not".

//
//   M2 — `paths` is accepted and consumed on all 30 verbs (kMcpUniversalFields says so, and the comment
//        above it has said so in prose) and was DECLARED on 18. The 12 undeclared verbs answer a multi-root
//        request correctly, so a schema-driven client was the only party that could not discover the form.
//   M4 — every `required` omitted `path`, which under the DEFAULT shipped install (`ripwire wrap claude`
//        passes no startup root) is required on all 30. Not a constant: a server started as
//        `ripwire <root> --mcp`, or the remote transport with a pinned workspace, supplies the root itself
//        and `path` is genuinely optional there. So it is rendered per-server from the policy, and the
//        answer is true for the server that gave it rather than true on average.
//   M12 — 0 of 84 declared properties carried a `description`, on a surface where `kind` is an enum on one
//        verb and a substring filter on four others. The description is the `needs` column: the per-verb
//        row from kMcpRequiredFields when there is one (so `symbol` on edit_check reads "the def name you
//        just edited" and on mentions "a code symbol name to find in doc backticks"), else the generic
//        row from kMcpValueFields. The schema and the refusal now say the same words about a field because
//        they read the same bytes.
//
// `required` is the Required-rule rows of kMcpRequiredFields — which reproduces all 30 hand-written
// `required` arrays exactly, verified by the gate; when that list comes out EMPTY the key is omitted
// rather than emitted as `[]` (identical meaning from draft-06 on, and the shape strict validators and
// the reference SDK expect).
//
